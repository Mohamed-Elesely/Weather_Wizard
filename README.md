Overview

The Weather App is a Kotlin-based application that retrieves weather data using the OpenWeather API. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and incorporates the following technologies:

Kotlin: The programming language used for developing the app, known for its conciseness and safety features.

MVVM Architecture: The app follows the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the concerns of data handling, business logic, and UI presentation.

Retrofit: A popular HTTP client library for Android that simplifies API integration by converting HTTP APIs into Kotlin interfaces.

RxJava: A reactive programming library that allows for easier handling of asynchronous and event-based operations in a reactive and composable manner.

LiveData: A part of the Android Jetpack library that provides lifecycle-aware data observation and allows for easy integration with the UI.

ViewModel: A part of the Android Jetpack library that stores and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner, allowing data to survive configuration changes.

OpenWeather API: An external API that provides weather data for different locations.

These technologies were chosen to ensure efficient network communication, separation of concerns, and improved user experience in terms of responsiveness and data handling.
